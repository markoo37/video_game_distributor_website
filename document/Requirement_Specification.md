Project Name: Game Distributor

Purpose: The purpose of this project is to create a website that allows users to create an account and gain access to various video games. We will be using Visual Studio Code as our IDE due to its simplicity and familiarity. We chose Visual Studio Code not only because it is simple and straightforward, but also very familiar for us to work with as we have already managed projects with its help in the past.

Intended Audience: The website is intended for anyone interested in purchasing and playing video games of different genres and difficulties. Whether it’s people who enjoy economic, political, scientific, sports-related topics, or those who enjoy questions from basic to advanced levels, they can find their interests on our website.

User Needs: Users need to find the website in any browser, register with their email and password, and then log in. Once logged in, they can see the main page of the web application where they can browse through the available games, choose one, purchase it, and then play it. From the user logging on the application to access the list of available games, then choosing the one they want and getting redirected to its content page, all the way to the detailed design of the pages, everything should be not only functionally plausible but also aesthetically pleasing for connected users.

System Rules, Patterns, Recommendations: For this project, we will use HTML and CSS for front-end development and PHP for back-end development. We will manage our project using tools like Git, Trello, and GitLab. For every problem we encounter, we will strive to find a good solution and try to use good technology. CSS and HTML will be the main languages we use.

Current Business Flow Model: Currently, there are many websites that sell video games online. However, our website aims to stand out by providing an enjoyable and easy-to-use experience for our users. Due to a lack of advertisements, these services seem unknown and easily rivaled in terms of popularity.

Project Outline: This project aims to help junior developers increase their knowledge and teamwork skills. We will use classes and IDs to divide the work into neat bundles of code. The work should use simple functionality that will make code neater throughout the entire project so this project will be a very simple one.

Current Situation: With the rapid advancement of technology, we decided to create a specialized website for distributing video games. We have already decided what the project will look like and have a team of 3 people working on it.

Goal: The goal of this project is to provide participants with the necessary skills to succeed in today’s volatile world of technology. We also aim to make the application user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing. Team members must work together to ensure that the application can demonstrate their skills in data manipulation and provide an enjoyable and easy-to-use experience. They should also show how they can work as a team.
